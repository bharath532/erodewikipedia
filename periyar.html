        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Erode Venkata Ramasamy, popularly known as Periyar, was born on 17 September 1879 in Erode, Tamil Nadu. He was a social reformer, rationalist, and staunch critic of the caste system, especially Brahminical dominance in Tamil society. Born into a wealthy trading family, Periyar initially joined the Indian National Congress in the early 1920s. However, disillusioned by the Congress’s Brahmin-dominated leadership and their reluctance to address caste inequalities, he left the party in 1925.That same year, he founded the Self-Respect Movement, aiming to instill dignity, rational thinking, and equality among oppressed communities, particularly the non-Brahmin Dravidian people. Periyar strongly opposed religious orthodoxy, idol worship, and gender discrimination. His advocacy for women’s rights, including widow remarriage and education, was revolutionary for his time.

            In 1944, he transformed the Justice Party into the Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), which became the foundation of modern Dravidian politics. Periyar promoted the idea of an independent Dravidian state called "Dravida Nadu" to counter North Indian dominance and Hindi imposition. He vehemently opposed Hindi being made India’s sole national language and led major protests against it in Tamil Nadu.
            
            A fierce rationalist, Periyar campaigned against superstition and religious dogma. He burned religious texts like the Manusmriti and criticized epics such as the Ramayana for promoting caste hierarchy and patriarchy.
            
            Though he never held public office, Periyar’s ideas deeply influenced Tamil Nadu’s socio-political landscape. His legacy lives on through the Dravidian political movement, which has dominated Tamil Nadu politics for decades.
            
            Periyar passed away on 24 December 1973, but he remains a powerful symbol of social justice, rationalism, and equality. His motto—“Educate, Agitate, Organize”—continues to inspire movements against social oppression.</p>
