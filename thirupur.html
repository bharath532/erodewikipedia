        <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Thirupur Kumaran, also known as Kodi Kaatha Kumaran (Kumaran who protected the flag), was a prominent Indian freedom fighter who played a significant role in the Indian independence movement. Born on October 4, 1904, in Chennimalai, Erode district, Tamil Nadu, he was a passionate nationalist from a young age and was deeply inspired by the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. Kumaran later moved to Tiruppur, where he founded the "Desa Bandhu Youth Association" to promote patriotism and involve the youth in the struggle for independence. He actively participated in protests against British rule and organized several demonstrations advocating for Indian self-rule. One of the most significant and tragic moments in Kumaran’s life occurred on January 11, 1932, during a protest march against the colonial government's repressive laws. Despite the ban on the Indian national flag by the British authorities, Kumaran courageously led a procession while holding the tricolor flag. The police attacked the protesters, and Kumaran was brutally beaten. He succumbed to his injuries but held onto the national flag until his last breath, not letting it fall to the ground. His unwavering courage and sacrifice made him a symbol of patriotic pride, especially in Tamil Nadu. Kumaran's martyrdom is remembered every year, and his legacy continues to inspire generations. A statue in his honor stands tall in Tiruppur, and he is celebrated as a true hero who gave his life to uphold the dignity of the Indian flag. His story is a testament to the valor and dedication of countless unsung heroes who laid down their lives for India’s freedom. Thirupur Kumaran’s life remains a shining example of selfless sacrifice and deep love for the motherland.</p>
