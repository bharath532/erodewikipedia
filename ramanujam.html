        <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant Indian mathematician whose extraordinary contributions to mathematics continue to influence the field today. Born on December 22, 1887, in Erode, Tamil Nadu, he grew up in modest circumstances and displayed a remarkable talent for mathematics from a young age. Despite limited access to formal education and academic resources, Ramanujan independently developed complex mathematical theories. His early work, published in Indian journals, eventually caught the attention of British mathematician G.H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge. Impressed by Ramanujan’s raw genius, Hardy invited him to England in 1914, where their collaboration led to groundbreaking discoveries in number theory, infinite series, continued fractions, and modular forms. Ramanujan had an intuitive grasp of mathematics, often arriving at correct results without formal proofs, which amazed and puzzled Western mathematicians. Among his many achievements, the Ramanujan Prime, Ramanujan theta function, and his work on partition functions are particularly significant. Despite his intellectual brilliance, Ramanujan struggled with health issues, exacerbated by the unfamiliar climate and food in England during World War I. He returned to India in 1919 in poor health and died the following year at the age of 32. In his short life, he compiled nearly 3,900 results, many of which were later proved correct and are still being studied today. Ramanujan was deeply spiritual, attributing his insights to divine inspiration, particularly from the Hindu goddess Namagiri. His legacy is celebrated globally—he was posthumously elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and his birthday, December 22, is observed as National Mathematics Day in India. His life story is a testament to innate genius and perseverance, inspiring countless mathematicians and students worldwide. The 2015 film The Man Who Knew Infinity further popularized his legacy, portraying the incredible journey of one of history’s most gifted mathematical minds.</p>
